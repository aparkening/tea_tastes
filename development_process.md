# My Sinatra Project Development Process

## 1. Plan project, imagine interface

Tea Tastes is a place write down and share thoughts about teas. Features:
- Anyone can view tea tasting notes, teas, tea shops, and users.
- Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own tea notes, as well as any teas and shops.
- Notes are related to users and teas, and teas are related to shops, so it's easy to view all teas in a shop, all notes in a shop, all teas from a specific user, etc.
- Teas are browse-able by additional attributes, such as category, region, and country.
