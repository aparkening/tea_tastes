# Tea Tastes

Tea Tastes is a place to record impressions of teas. Features:

- Anyone can view tea tasting notes, teas, tea shops, and users.
- Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own tea notes, as well as any teas and shops.
- Notes are related to users and teas, and teas are related to shops, so it's easy to view all teas in a shop, all notes in a shop, all teas from a specific user, etc.
- Teas are browseable by additional attributes, such as category, region, and country.
